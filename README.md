# Bubbles

Some components for [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbraclet/bubbletea):

* Spinner
* Text Input
* Paginator
* Viewport

## Spinner

A spinner, useful for indicating that some kind of invisible operation is
happening. There are a couple default ones, but you can also pass your own
”frames.”

## Text Input

A text input field, akin to an `<input type="text">` in HTML.

## Paginator

A component for handling pagination logic and optionally drawing pagination UI.

## Viewport

A viewport for vertically scrolling content which optionally includes standard
pager keybindings and mouse wheel support. A high performance mode is available
for applications which make use of the alterate screen buffer. This is
generally only necessary when dealing with content with a very large amount of
ANSI escape sequences.
